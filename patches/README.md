# Patches Directory

This directory contains patches that are automatically applied to git submodules during the build process.

## fprime-gds-version.patch

This patch updates the `fprime-gds` version requirement in `lib/fprime/requirements.txt` from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1a2.

**Why:** The project requires fprime-gds 4.1.1a2 for specific features:
- file-uplink-cooldown argument
- file-uplink-chunk-size argument

The patch is automatically applied by the `make submodules` target to ensure version consistency and eliminate the version mismatch warning.

**Application:** This patch is applied automatically when running `make submodules` (or `make` which includes that target).
