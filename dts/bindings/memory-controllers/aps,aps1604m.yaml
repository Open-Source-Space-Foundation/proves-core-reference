  APMemory APS1604M 16Mbit (2MB) QSPI PSRAM.
  Typically used as a child of a QSPI/flash controller (e.g. raspberrypi,pico-flash-controller).

compatible: "aps,aps1604m"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: Chip-select (address) and size in bytes (address-cells, size-cells from parent).

  cs-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Chip select GPIO for this device (e.g. CE#). When the parent controller
      does not drive CS, the driver uses this pin to assert/deassert around transfers.
      Typically one entry, e.g. cs-gpios = <&gpio0 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>.

  spi-max-frequency:
    type: int
    description: Maximum SPI/QSPI clock frequency in Hz (e.g. 84000000 for 84 MHz).

  size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Memory size in bytes. Use when parent has no size-cells (e.g. under SPI bus
      where reg is only chip-select). For APS1604M use 2097152 (2MB).
