# Components::ImuManager

The IMU Manager (Inertial Measurement Unit) component provides sensor data related to motion and orientation of the craft. It interfaces with the LIS2MDL and LSM6DSO sensors via Zephyr drivers to provide acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field, and temperature measurements. It also supports configuration of sampling frequencies and axis orientation.

## Usage Examples

The IMU Manager component is designed to be scheduled periodically to trigger collection of sensor data and telemetering. It operates as a passive component that responds to scheduler calls.

### Typical Usage

1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup.
2. The component is configured with pointers to the Zephyr devices for LIS2MDL and LSM6DSO.
3. The scheduler calls the `run` port at regular intervals.
4. On each run call, the component:
   - Fetches sensor data from the sensors.
   - Applies axis orientation corrections.
   - Outputs telemetry for acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field.
