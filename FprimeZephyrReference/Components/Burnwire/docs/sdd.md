# Components::Burnwire

Driving the Burnwire on and off. This component activates the two pins that are required to heat the burnwire resisitor. The burnwire deployment will be handled by the Antenna Deployment, that will call the ports in the burnwire deployment. For testing, the commands to directly call the burnwire have been left in.

Burnwire is agnostic to the ideal safety count, it simply sets it to be whatever the port or command passes onto

| Name | Description | Validation |
| ---- | -----------  | ------ |
|BW-001|The burnwire shall turn on and off in response to a port calls (TBR for antenna deployer component) |Hardware Test|
|BW-002|The burnwire shall turn on and off in response to commands (TBR for testing for now) |Hardware Test|
|BW-003|The burnwire component shall provide an event when it is turned on and off |Integration Test|
|BW-004|The burnwire component shall activate by turning both the GPIO pins that activate the burnwire | Hardware Test|
|BW-005|The burnwire component shall be controlled by a safety timeout attached to a 1Hz rate group |Integration Test|
|BW-006|The safety timeout shall emit an event when it is changes | Integration test|
|BW-007|The burnwire safety time shall emit an event when it starts and stops |Integration Test|

##  Tests
Add unit test descriptions in the chart below
| Name | Description | Output | Coverage |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
|TestSafety|Tests Burnwire turns off after SAFETY_TIMER seconds|Integration|---|
