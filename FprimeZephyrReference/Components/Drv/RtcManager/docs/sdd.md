# Components::RtcManager

The RTC Manager component interfaces with the Real Time Clock (RTC) to provide time measurements. When the RTC is unavailable, the component automatically fails over to monotonic time (uptime since boot) to ensure continuous system operation.

### Typical Usage

#### `TIME_SET` Command Usage
1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup
2. A ground station sends a `TIME_SET` command with the desired time
3. On each command, the component:
    - Validates the time data (year >= 1900, month [1-12], day [1-31], hour [0-23], minute [0-59], second [0-59])
    - Emits validation failure events if any field is invalid
    - Sets the time on the RTC if validation passes
    - Emits a `TimeSet` event with the previous time if the time is set successfully
    - Emits a `TimeNotSet` event if the time is not set successfully
    - Emits a `DeviceNotReady` event if the device is not ready

#### `timeGetPort` Port Usage
1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup
2. In a deployment topology, a `time connection` relation is made to sync FPrime's internal clock
3. On each call, the component:
    - Checks if the RTC device is ready
    - If the RTC is ready:
        - Fetches time from the RTC hardware
        - Returns time with `TB_WORKSTATION_TIME` time base
    - If the RTC is not ready (failover mode):
        - Logs a warning message (throttled to prevent console flooding)
        - Fetches monotonic uptime from the system
        - Returns time with `TB_PROC_TIME` time base (uptime since boot)
    - Calculates microseconds from system clock cycles for sub-second precision

## Requirements

## Sequence Diagrams

### `timeGetPort` port

The `timeGetPort` port is called from a `time connection` in a deployment topology to sync the RTC's time with FPrime's internal clock. The component automatically falls back to monotonic uptime if the RTC is unavailable.

### `TIME_SET` Command

The `TIME_SET` command is called to set the current time on the RTC. The component validates all time fields before attempting to set the time.
